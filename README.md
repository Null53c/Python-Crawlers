# Python-Crawlers
I like building crawlers because sometimes people pay me? Here you'll find some of my projects and projects I was never paid out on and I'm therefore open-sourcing also some of them are creepy. Regardless enjoy and use!  

#### disclaimer: Im not a pervert for crawling the contents i do they're simply more of a challenge to crawl because of all their "preventive" messures plus sometimes I get paid by chinese friends to do this and I have no shame. 

#### 4chan crawler 
Crawls 4chan images and stores them in a NSFW file.  
        -> `4chan-imgs.py`   
  
#### 85814.com crawlers  
Gets the HD imgs multithread file by name sorting the best crawler ive yet built  
        -> `crawl_85841_images_optimized.py`       
Was prototype for my masterpice above   
        -> `crawl_85814_images.py`       
  
#### whitelist_4_crawlers -> pretty self explanatory ip's that dont freak out being crawled and some that crawl. Your welcome. 

#### mzitu.com crawlers -> I was going to be paid for this work but never got the second half of the payment so open sourcing I also got                             pretty carried away... I will list in order of code quality and results. 
-> `crawl_girl_images.py`  
-> `crawl_mzitu_images_Model1_V1.py`   
-> `crawl_mzitu_images_Model1_V2.py`   
-> `crawl_mzitu_images_Model2.py`    
-> `crawl_mzitu_images_Model1_V2_Diff.py`
